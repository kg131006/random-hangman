Hangman Game 🎮

Made a random Hangman game as my first CS project! Thought I’d go beyond the usual “Hello World” and try something a bit more fun. Here’s my Hangman game—guess the word before the hangman meets his fate! 😬

Features:
	•	Random words from different categories (fruits, animals, etc.)
	•	Classic console gameplay—guess letters and watch the hangman get drawn! 

How to Play:
	1.	Guess a letter.
	2.	If you’re wrong, the hangman gets closer to being fully drawn.
	3.	Guess the word before the hangman is complete!

Installation:
	1.	Clone the repo
	2.	Run python hangman.py

Hope you enjoy it! It’s simple, but hey, it’s a start! 😄
